Your exit isn't for another 100 miles, so we're good. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Thanks.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yup, no problem.

<<SetExpression Daniella Nervous>>
Wow, it's coming down really hard.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah. It'll be fine. Rain is pretty calming. I could sleep in this.

I'm scared. I can't see anything, Mish.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Nervous>>
Yeah, wow do you need me to take over?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I can't even see the side of the road. 
How am I supposed to pull over? 
Oh my god a big 18 wheeler is coming behind me. What do I do?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Hey! You're okay. 
You're going to be fine. 
Go as fast as you're comfortable. They'll pass you.

<<SetExpression Mish Angry>>
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was going to rain this hard, but it's just rain, Dani. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
It's not just rain, Mish! It's everyone on the road driving faster than me, and your car's wipers aren't doing anything. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
 No car wipers could make this any better. Just go slow! Stop being so nervous! It'll just make things worse.

Now, just keep driving straight. 
You're doing fine. 
If there's a turn, you'll see it. I'm on the lookout, too.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
I'm fine. We're okay. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
You're a pro driver. You've got this. If gays can't drive, you're the exception. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
Yeah… Yeah! I'm the exception!

<<PlaySound AudioManager Car_Swerve>>

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Maybe we should exit!


<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Nervous>>
Just point the way. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Okay, exit here on the left. Put your emergency lights on and go slow. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I know! I've got this.

<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
I'm going to pull into this neighborhood. 

<<StopSound AudioManager Rain_Heavy>>

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Sounds good. Wait, did you see that sign near the entrance?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
No, what did it say?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Yard Sard. And then an arrow pointing forward.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
I LOVE YARD SARDS. Let's follow it. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Sounds good to me!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
YALE SALE.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
YADE SALE! We're close. I can feel it. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Hey, there it is with the garage open! 
And it's stopped raining almost completely. 
If that's not a sign to go in, I don't know what is.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Let's go check it out!
