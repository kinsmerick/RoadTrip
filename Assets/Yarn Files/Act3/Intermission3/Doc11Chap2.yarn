Hi! This is a really cool selection of things!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Oh, hi! Thank you so much! I'm Jam and this is Honey.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Hello! We're moving soon because-

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I'm pregnant!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Wow! Congrats

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Thank you so much! They're our little bun in the oven.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Our sourdough bread!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Good one, Honey!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Thank you, Jam. May I say, you two look like a great couple.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Oh no we-

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
We love couples. I don't know where I'd be without this one.
She knows exactly what to say to make me feel special.
I bet it's the same for you two.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
That's really sweet.
Mish does do a great job of talking me through things,
but we're not-

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I loved making all these memories with Jam.
And now we'll make more with our new baby.
Please look around!
You two deserve to furnish your home with love like we have!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I actually have something I think you both would adore.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Oh, you'd love this.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Wow! This is… so cute! Thank you so much.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
See, I knew she'd love it.
I loved it so much! It's so unique.
If you put batteries in, it sings you a love song!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You have such good taste.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I'm going to go look around now.

// I want honey and jam to talk at the same time but idk if that's possible
<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Enjoy!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>

I love you.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Honey>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
No, I love you!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Jam>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You're so cute…

Look at all these GAMES for real GAMERS. Let’s see…
A dungeon crawler game,
a rat themed card game,
and a vampire fighter game?
These are all too cool for me!!
