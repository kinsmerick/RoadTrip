Everything is becoming so familiar now!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah, we’re only a little bit out.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Wow… God, I’m really going home.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
What’s next for you?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Like, when I get home?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah.

<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
I’m going to hug my mom for 5 hours, 
then probably take a shower and sleep for days. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Sure, but what about after that?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I don’t really know. I didn’t really think too far ahead. I just couldn’t be alone anymore.

I really didn’t put much thought into it.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
So, do you think leaving was an impulse?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I… No. It was very intentional. I really hated being there. I hated being so close to… I just needed to be with people I loved.

<<SetExpression Mish Sad>>
Yeah.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Sad>> 
It’s a reset. I really need a do-over of my life. Maybe pursue a passion?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Like art? You’re really good at that.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
Haha thanks… Maybe. It’ll be nice to be creative for myself and not for design projects and clients. Or, maybe I can just sit in my room for the rest of my life. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
As long as you’re happy.

I think that I’ll be better at home.
At least better than I was.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
I don’t know if you care to hear this, but I’m proud of you for doing this. It’s a big change.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I like to think if I could move across the country for someone else, I can also do it for myself.

<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
I don’t really know if I’m at a place to be happy yet, but one day. 
It’s been a long recovery process.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Sad>>
What are you referring to?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I don’t know… Everything? 
It took awhile for me to actually get back to a normal life,
 but when I realized that wasn’t happening as smoothly as I wanted, I started packing.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Yeah, I’m sorry. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
There’s no need to be sorry. It was mutual, right?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah...

It’s getting pretty late. Were you planning on starting the trip back tonight?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Embarrassed>>
Well, I was, yeah, because I didn’t want to impose on your family. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Family, shmamily. You’re not going to start your drive back at midnight. No, you’re going to stay with us for the night and head out early in the morning.  

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Are you sure?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Oh my god, you’re so annoying, 
YES. It’ll be fine. 
My mom will welcome you with no questions. I’ll text her.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Thanks, Daniella. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Of course. Now, come on. 
Let’s focus up and finish this stretch of road. 
I can smell my mom’s arroz con gandules from here.
