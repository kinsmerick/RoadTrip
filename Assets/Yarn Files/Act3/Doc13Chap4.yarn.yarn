I’m sorry you have to make that long drive back yourself.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Don’t sweat it. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Are you excited to get back to work?

<<if $forgiveness >= 0>>

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Not really, haha.
It’s going to be weird not having you in the same city.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Not to sound rude, but why? You never reached out at all.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I know, I just thought at some point I would. 
I thought I would ask you out to coffee and we’d catch up. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I wish you did earlier. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Would you have stayed?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
No, but I would’ve enjoyed having a friend. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I’m glad you reached out. 
Even if it was just for help moving… 
I missed you.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Don’t say that. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
We dated for three years. You were my best friend. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
You were mine, too. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
So, yeah. I enjoyed spending time with you during this trip. 
And, I’ll miss you. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I guess I’ll miss you, too. 
Okay, shut up, we can text each other.
 We can grab virtual coffee if you want. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah, haha. I think I’d really like that.  

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
You have to get up early tomorrow. 
Try to wake me up but if I don’t, text me when you get home, okay?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Sounds good to me. Goodnight Dani.


<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Night Mish.

<<else>>

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah! I think so. 
I have a lot of work to do.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Oh yeah, I bet. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I think I miss Old York already haha.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I think it misses you! The city suits you.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Thanks. I’m sure your family is excited to have you back.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah my mom was pretty emotional while you were getting stuff from the car.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
That’s awesome! It’ll be good.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah. I’m happy to be home. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
So, I guess this is it.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I have an early start!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah! Of course. We should get to sleep. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Agreed.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Well, I probably won’t wake up tomorrow. So, good luck with everything! 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Thanks, you too. I hope you find what you’re looking for.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
...Okay. Thanks.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah, no problem. Night!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Night.
