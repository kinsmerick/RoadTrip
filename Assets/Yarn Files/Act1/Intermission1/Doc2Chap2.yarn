That's such a cute dog!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Eh, she's whiney sometimes,
and she pees on the floor,
but she loves people a whole lot.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
She's very fluffy. I bet she gets a lot of pats.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You'd be surprised at how many people come here to see Lucy.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
They come… to the gas station?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You bet your sweet bippy they do. I come here every day, and people line up for miles to get a glimpse of Lucy.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I'm sure they do…

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
It's the key to happiness, really. Doing something because someone else loves it.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Well, you want to make sure you're doing what's best for you, too.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I don't know. Every time I look at Lucy, I'm reminded of why I stand here every day. 
She wasn't the same after my wife passed, but this really makes her smile.
Here, take this. I think you'll like it.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Wow! Thank you so much.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I hope to see you again some day!
