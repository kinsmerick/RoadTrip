That’s such a cute dog!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Eh, she’s whiney sometimes,
and she pees on the floor,
but she loves people a whole lot.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
She’s very fluffy. I bet she gets a lot of pats.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You’d be surprised at how many people come here to see Lucy.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
They come… to the gas station?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
You bet your sweet bippy they do. I come here every day, and people line up for miles to get a glimpse of Lucy.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I’m sure they do…

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Carl>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Here, take this. I think you’ll like it.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Wow! Thank you.

My sweet baby Lucy…
