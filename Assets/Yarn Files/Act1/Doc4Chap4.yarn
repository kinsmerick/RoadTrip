What's one thing you wish we did differently?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
What do you mean?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
You know what I mean. In our relationship, what do you think we could've done better?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Oh Dani, I don't know what you want me to say. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I don't want you to say anything… Sometimes, I just don't know where we went so wrong.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Do you have ideas on how we could've done better?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I know I could've talked to you more. I could've been there more-

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
You shouldn't put all of the blame on yourself. 
We both could've been there for each other more.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
...Yeah… 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
It's in the past. We can't change what happened.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah.

<<if $forgiveness >= -1>>
<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
So, after everything… Was it ever hard? 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Was what ever hard?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Being alone. Everything was changing so fast.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah… It wasn't easy. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I would stay up all night watching the door sometimes. I think I thought someone was going to break in.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I definitely didn't like the fact that I had a queen size bed all to myself. 
I think I bought 5 pillows just to fill the empty space.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
My studio apartment was only big enough for a twin. I still had my stuffed animals around me though. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Haha, I do miss your giant stuffed whale.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah, Bluey is a good sleep buddy.
It's getting late. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah, we should get some sleep. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Sweet dreams.

// shouldn't be necessary but will keep this here: if $forgiveness < -1 

<<else>>

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Did you have a hard time with the breakup?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
That's a loaded question and it's almost 1am.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah, sorry. Forget it. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
We should get some rest for an early start tomorrow.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah, goodnight.
