No problem.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
The roads are pretty empty right now.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>

<<set $forgiveness to $forgiveness + 0>>
Thank you again…For lending me your car and your arms for three days.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Is that all I am to you? 
Arms and a car?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
You know what I mean! 
You didn’t have to help me.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
And what, 
have you spend thousands to ship everything home? 
You hate flying. It’s really no problem.

I’m surprised you woke up on time. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
What’s that supposed to mean?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I always had to drag you out of bed in the morning for work!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Hah, I think you’re exaggerating a bit there, 
but I guess I’ve turned into a morning person since then.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
When you called to ask, 
I was really shocked to hear that you were moving.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
You couldn’t have expected me to stay in Old York forever, could you? 
There’s nothing here for me.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Embarrassed>>
Yeah. 
I guess I was the one who dragged you here. 
Well, I’m glad you’re making plans!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
If you consider me moving back in with my parents “plans,”
 then, yeah. I have hella plans. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
What I wouldn’t give to hang out with your parents 24/7.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
Yeah, okay, sure.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Honest!

<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Did you tell them about…

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
[[Us? Yeah. It’s chill.|BRANCH2A]]

Us? Yeah. It’s chill.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Oh! Cool.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
We broke up 7 months ago, 
you think I wouldn’t tell my parents?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Embarrassed>>
I mean, yeah, but I am helping you move. 
Do they still like me? 
Do you think they’ll beat me up when they see me again?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Nah. If you didn’t help me… 
then, maybe they would kick your ass. 
They know I don’t have a car. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Speaking of cars, 
this one needs a quick fill before we get too far out of town. 
Do you mind if we pull over?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah no, 
let’s keep going until we’re stranded on the side of the road. 
Sorry, yeah we can.

Umm
About what? 
The end to our little shindig? 
Yeah just a little.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
If you call 3 years a shindig then yeah, sure. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
You know what I mean.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I went over to your house... 
Met your parents... 
Your mom made me special menudo!
<<SetExpression Mish Angry>> 
She called it Mish’s Menudo!
That’s a “shindig” to you?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Mish, it’s a joke!
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>> 
Yes, I told them about us breaking up. 
I told them you were helping me drive back home, too. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Embarrassed>>
Right, sorry, I know!  
Uhh, 
so we need to fill up before we get too far. 
Can we make a stop?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah, I don’t care.
