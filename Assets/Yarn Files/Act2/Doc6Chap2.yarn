You know I don't have a problem being social right? 
As long as I'm with good people.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
What are you talking about?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Earlier, you said I didn't like being social, but I do. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah, of course. 
I didn't mean it like you hated people, 
but I know in Old York, you stopped wanting to go out. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Angry>>
I stopped wanting to go out because I didn't feel like I was with good people.

Hey, I'm not saying that- 
but wait, why did you think my coworkers weren't good people?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
That's not fair to them. 
They joke around. They didn't mean to offend you. 
You're the one who walked off.
You're the one who can't take a joke.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
I'm sorry that I believe I deserve to be in a space where others respect me. 
And I'm sorry I felt like I didn't have to sit there 
while they made fun of me because I was being quiet.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Angry>>
You know, you could've just told me that, 
and I would've defended you. 
But it's like you developed this problem with telling me things. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Oh, so what happened was my fault for not staying and telling you I was offended? 
Me walking off wasn't a clue?

You don't remember when they made me so upset I had to leave?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
I know they upset you, but they didn't mean it. 
You know that they can be a little bit much.
Sometimes, you can be too sensitive about things. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
You still could have stood up for me. 
You just sat there like I was nothing! 
I walked off and you did nothing.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Angry>>
You can't just be sad over that when you didn't tell me anything. 
You just walked off when you could've talked about it like an adult. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Angry>>
You know it's hard for me to open up to strangers! 
I thought you knew me well enough to understand my body language. 
I was UNCOMFORTABLE!

It was hard to read you Dani! 
It was always hard to read you… 
You stopped talking to me, you stopped telling me things.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Angry>>
Oh yeah? Like what.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Like your dad. 
Why didn't you tell me about your dad?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
When was I going to tell you about my dad being in the hospital?
You were never around.
You chose your friends over me
every single time.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Wow, Dani. You know, I realize that maybe I should've been home more, 
but that doesn't mean I deserved the complete shutout you gave me. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>

What?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I think the engine overheated. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Nervous>>
Well what am I supposed to do? 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I think there's a gas station close by. 
Can you go see if you can grab some snacks for us
or something?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
YOU WANT ME TO WALK BY MYSELF?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
You have the moon. It's fine.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
God. Seriously, Mish?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I'm the one with a car to take care of! 
Look, the moon is bright enough! Just go... 
please. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Fine. Whatever. 

<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Thought>>
This is fine. The moon will guide me. 
She is my girlfriend, my protector..
