Wow… Hell is real?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
What are you talking about?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Did you not see that sign back there? 
HELL IS REAL

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>

Oh my god, hell is real? 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
That's what I'm saying!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
Does this mean we're in the middle of nowhere?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
We are officially entering the Midwest, yes.

Isn't it an insane thought that...
there are two powerful beings, 
one above the earth and one below,
just waiting for us to die so they can choose favorites?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Like team captains in dodgeball.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Are you insinuating 
that someone is bound to be the last person on earth? 
Because no one wants them?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Someone is BOUND to be last.
Like in dodgeball.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Why are you going back to dodgeball?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I don't know.
We're near where I grew up and we used to play a lot of dodgeball.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Were you picked last?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
...The Midwest was never kind to baby Mish. 
Baby Mish had too many existential crises when they saw hell signs.

Ahh, the Midwest. 
I wonder how many more signs we'll see about- 
Oh, there's another one. “Gays are going to hell.” 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Wow that one was handmade. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
If my friends and I were truly hell bound, 
I think we'd have a pretty good time. 
I think Satan would look at me and say, 
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
“Who is she? I want to know her.”
Do you think Satan is gay? 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
I think Satan is gay and would throw a party for all of us. 
I think I'd be friends with him. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
YES that'd be so sick. Like that one back in college with Bri and her friends.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Oh god, don't remind me. I'm still nauseous from that night.

Remember when you dove into the pool fully clothed?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
And I made you drive me home. Yes I remember that. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Come on, it wasn't that bad. 
At least you sat on a towel so your car wouldn't get wet. 
I tucked you into bed.

That night was such a disaster. 
Bri had to stop you from stealing her dog 
and then you jumped into a pool. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Okay, I don't think it was that dramatic, 
and at least I knew how to swim. 
You wouldn't even go in!

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
It was like 60 degrees at night! Just admit that it was a terrible night.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
I will not.

I was lucky that you volunteered to be the D.D., 
otherwise I know we wouldn't have left until 2am. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Happy>>
Yeah, I'm pretty useful.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Smile>>
Thanks for going out then. 
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
I know you didn't like being social with me all the time, 
but I really appreciated it. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
No problem.
