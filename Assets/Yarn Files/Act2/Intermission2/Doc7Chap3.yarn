Uhh. Excuse me, miss?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Ah, welcome… 
What can I do for you? 
Better yet, what can you do for me?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
What?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
What is it you seek, my dear?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Can I have a canister for gas?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Ahhh you wish to fill a canister with gas, 
but first, to obtain my answer you must pass…
this test I give to all who seek, 
undying truths and passions bleak.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
O…kay…

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
What's black...and white… and RED all over?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Oh yes I know this one! A newspaper?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>> 
Are you sure?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
I think so? Yes?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>> 
Congratulations my dear… 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Thank you. So can I have a canister for gas?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Martha>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>> 
My oh my, we haven't had gas here in YEARS.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Oh. Thanks anyway?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Thought>>
No gas? What kind of place is this? 
I guess I should go tell Mish.

Enjoy your lollipop!

Umm
Hey
So
There was no gas. 
Sorry.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
That's alright. Turns out we didn't actually need gas. The car just got a little overheated, but it'll be fine. Let's head out.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetBubbleStyle DialogueManager Standard>>
Yeah, let's hit the road.
