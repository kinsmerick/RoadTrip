So there was this really weird woman at the gas station.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
Yeah? What happened?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
So, she made me answer this riddle 
and then gave me a lollipop all before telling me there was no gas. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Oh my god. Martha still works there?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Wait how do you- 
Oh, wow. We’re already in your hometown? 
That means we only have like one stretch left. 

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Yeah! Wow, I can’t believe they put her on the night shift. Was the playground still there?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>

No, it was all cut up and torn apart… She looked so lonely sitting by herself.

Man, I remember as a kid, 
I would love going to that playground because of Martha. 
I got those riddles wrong almost every time, 
but she still gave me a lollipop.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
<<SetExpression Daniella Neutral>>
Damn. So I’m not special for getting one?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Happy>>
Haha she may have gotten hard over the years, but she just wanted to make us laugh and feel special. I’m so jealous you got to see Martha.

Not really, but it kind of had this spooky aesthetic. 
The poles were cut and there was this horse all alone. 
You’d like it, but I was scared out of my mind.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Not even the slide was left?
 Wow that sucks. 
That was the only playground around.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Daniella>>
Yeah, but I’m sure that kids are amused by anything. 
They don’t really need a gas station playground right?
 I can’t imagine the fumes being healthy.

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
No, you’re right I guess. It’s better that it’s gone.

Yeah. It’s getting late. Did you plan on stopping here?

<<SetSpeaker DialogueManager Mish>>
<<SetExpression Mish Neutral>>
Yeah let’s pull in for the night. I wanted to get a little farther, but that’s alright.
