So, what do you think you're going to do first when you get home?
<<setBubble GameManager DriverOutCar>>
[[Don't know... Probably hug my mom.|HUGMOM]]
[[Take a shower definitely. And then sleep for days.|SHOWER]]

Man, I miss your mom. She did give the best hugs. She made the best tasting food, too... 
Remember when we had that weird pasta with beans?
<<setBubble GameManager DriverInCar>>
You ate like five bowls. You’re lucky she made everything potluck style, but my grandma still barely got a plate...
I think she always resented you for that.
<<changeShot GameManager Side>>
<<setBubble GameManager PassengerFar>>
I could’ve given your grandma everything on my plate and she would’ve still hated me. 
She was a tough nut to crack…
<<setBubble GameManager DriverClose>>
[[Don’t mess with a woman’s beans... I remember she joked about not wanting you to be at the funeral after that. My grandpa really enjoyed having you there, though.|FAMILY]]
[[She was the TOUGHEST nut. And I respected the hell out of her for it. Never took no for an answer. Told people exactly what she wanted. You know she wrestled a woman for the last baby stroller in the store to surprise my mom when I was born?|STROLLER]]

I really enjoyed being there for your grandpa. 
He told the best stories… 
I’m glad I was able to be there with you, too. I know how close you were with your grandparents. 
Your whole family is very close. It always made me jealous…

I believe that woman would wrestle an alligator for you. 
Your family has always been tight-knit...
I wish I could say the same.
I was always jealous of that.

Yeah, I feel the weight of my sweat through my shirt. 
Are you going to stay in your old bedroom? 
Have you talked to them about that?
<<changeShot GameManager Side>>
<<setBubble GameManager DriverClose>>
I… haven’t really spoken to my parents about logistics. 
After everything… 
when I reached out…
they just really wanted me to come home…
<<setBubble GameManager DriverFar>>
I really wanted to go home. 
<<setBubble GameManager PassengerClose>>
If going home is what you want to do, don’t feel guilty about doing what’s best for you. 
Be bold. Take risks! 
Remember when that old man cut you off on our way to the movies?

[[I remember you pushing me to give him the finger... Then I remember when I tried to pass him, YOU flipped him off,... leading to him FOLLOWING us for the next fifty thousand miles.|OLDMAN]]
[[I like to remember the movie instead... I still can’t believe the girl was actually a centaur. The SFX people did wonders with those hooves...The guy went to school with her every day and didn’t realize it? A centaur… would you date a centaur?|MOVIE]]

 I actually distinctly remember you freaking out and wanting to drive to the police station. 
He gave up after we pulled off the highway like I told you he would... 
He was just a grumpy little man. 
Good movie though.
I can never unsee that actress with hooves... 
The dude still fell in love after all that, so it couldn’t have been that much of a deal-breaker.

In a fictional scenario where centaurs exist… 
I… 
actually don’t know if I’d date a centaur. 
She’d have to be a good person. 
Funny… 
Smart… 
Oh my god, I think I would date a centaur.

It took a lot for my family to become close, but they really loved you...
I was always jealous of the freedom you had to go anywhere and do anything.
I think it made you super accomplished. Getting a job in Old York? That’s everyone’s dream. 
<<setBubble GameManager PassengerOutCar>>
Yeah... I guess.

You should put “must have hooves” in your dating profile. 
I’m sure it would drive the people wild.
<<setBubble GameManager PassengerOutCar>>
Change it to “may have hooves and if the date goes well, I’ll consider it” and I’m sold.
