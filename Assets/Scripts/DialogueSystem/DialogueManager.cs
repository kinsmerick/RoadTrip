/*The DialogueManager creates Yarn Commands SetSpeaker and SetBubblePosition. SetSpeaker changes the current speaker,
 adjusts the speech bubble's color according to that current speaker, and moves the speech bubble accordingly. If in
 exploration, it will call a method that moves the bubble to above the character's GameObject. If in a car or motel
 scene, it will adjust the speech bubble according to the current bubble position being used, i.e. "Far". The
 current bubble position can be changed by calling SetBubblePosition. This searches through the current speaker's
 array of bubble positions, finds the matching name, and moves the speech bubble to that set position. This DOES
 require the characters in car and motel scenes (aka Daniella and Mish) to have mirroring pairs of bubble positions,
 but this was already planned.
 
 Also of note: since only Daniella faces dialogue choices, the option bubbles only need to get moved in relation to her.
 In Exploration, these elements will be children of her GameObject, and will remain in a constain relation to her, so 
 they do not need to be adjusted. For car and motel scenes, they will need to be adjusted according to various shots.
 Their positions are included within the general speech bubble position struct in CharacterManager, so, whenever 
 SetBubblePosition is called, they get moved to the position, so long as the current speaker is Daniella.
 
 YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
 - Yarn Command SetBubbleStyle that will change the type of speech bubble being printed, i.e. a]
 thought bubble, a standard bubble, an emotional/excited bubble, etc.
 - Yarn Command ChangeShot that will de-activate the previous shot's environment art and activate the given shot's
   environment art. Only called in car scenes.*/
