/* OptionTextDisplayHandler implements three interfaces, one for pointer enter and then select and deselect.
 * These events set the selected object in the Event system and the Option text bubbles' text color, respectively.
 * The Options buttons' colors are handled by the Button component, but the text needs to change color to maintain
 * readability when the images change color. The color, for now, can be set in the Editor to be Daniella's character
 * color for testing purposes, but when that color is decided, it will be made a constant within this class.*/
